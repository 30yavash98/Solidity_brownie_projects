hey guys, it's a simple project based on a blast game on bet websites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just try to create a mindset, may my code doesn't be optimized but I do my best
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
give me your feedback and ideas about the project <3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and just remember to there are many default numbers in the project, so be my guest and change them :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** How it works ***

1) we start the game, players enter blast, and we take random number by vrfcoordinator (it may take some time)

2) the contract calculates the random ratio of blast based on chance (you can change them in the getRatio function) 

3) and finally we pay winners based on their ratio (their ratio must be less or equal to the random ratio)

4) there is a 2% of chance getting 0 on the random ratio
